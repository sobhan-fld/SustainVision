# Example config for evaluating pretrained MobileNet Small SupCon with COCO object detection
# 
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Download COCO dataset first using "Download databases" menu
# 2. Train your feature space model (e.g., SupCon on CIFAR-10)
# 3. Update checkpoint_path to point to your trained model
# 4. Run this config to fine-tune detection head on COCO
